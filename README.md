This repo is used to store homeworks in stats 507 and corporate with other students on some projects.

In ps2 problem 3, I use Pandas to read, clean, and append several data files from the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey NHANES. In this problem, I use the four cohorts spanning the years 2011-2018. Part A and b clean the
data and part c report the number of cases in two datasets. The local file path is : C:\Users\MSI\Desktop\stats507
